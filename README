Welcome to the High-Level Virtual Machine (HLVM) project. This open source project is designed to provide a virtual machine to support modern statically-typed functional programming languages easily and with performance characteristics ideally suited to scientific computing.

HLVM is built entirely upon the LLVM infrastructure:

  http://llvm.org

HLVM requires LLVM 2.4 or newer. The "llvm-patch.txt" file contains a patch to the current LLVM code base that adds OCaml bindings for LLVM's instructions to handle first-class structs and also enables tail calls globally in LLVM.

Once LLVM is compiled and installed (and assuming OCaml is installed), HLVM may be compiled using the script:

$ ./compile.sh

This creates an "hlvm" executable that, when run, JIT compiles and benchmarks a series of
tests.

Debug mode may be enabled with:

$ ./hlvm --debug

in which case extensive information is printed to the console describing the process of compilation (which is ideal for debugging when LLVM calls abort due to a type error in the generated code) and also from print statements injected into the generated code itself (e.g. to describe what the GC is doing as it runs).
